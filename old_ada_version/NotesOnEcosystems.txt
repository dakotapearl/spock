Inherient complexity is a necessity
   Parasitic aspects

Be clear about the energy exchanges within the systems.
   eg Food provided by inputs
   Evolutionary persuation previded by positive or negative re-enforcement of action-taking decisions

Potentially successful models must be given the time they need to achieve success. 

Lifecycle: Increased threat on survival could result in mutations or sub-speciation

Measure of complexity: How highly coupled a system is.

Could one species protect another? Would this provide any use?

Many elements to an ecosystem:
   Resources: Inputs
   Species: Models
   Population level: "
   Competition: Raising and lowering the population via growth and conflicting species
   Differences in species: Genetic algorithm to determine species' features
   Tie to input/output modelling: Modelling efficiency proportional to efficiency within ecosystem. This allows efficent models to stay alive and breed and potentially develop even more efficent models. Also that the more efficent models with kill off the less efficent models, thereby making the system as a whole more efficent.
   
Global effects:
   Similar to a burst of neurotransmitters in human brains
   Affect the qualities of all parts of the system
   eg A variable that raises as a beneficial input in received and then drops off gradually
   
Probabilty modelling idea:
   Build e^x^2 type functions to 
   
Efficency is dependent on a number of factors:
   Computational drain
   Adherence to goal conditions
   Model correctness
